# An Example of the Working of the Activity Lifecycle

- Let's take an example of Instagram App
   
      h1 align = "center"> Login Page </h1>

 - We enter the enter the credentials to log in.

![login-page-image](https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/activity-lifecycle.png)

 - After entering the credentials click on 'LOG IN' button and let's call the UI as 'Activity 1'

![login-page-image](https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/activity-lifecycle.png)

 - Just after clicking the Log in Button the Activity 1 goes to pause state and onPause() Method is called.

 - We redirect to next UI which is a another Activity and we call it as 'Activity 2'

![login-page-image](https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/activity-lifecycle.png)
  
 - When 'Activity 2' is opened up, the onCreate() method is called.

 - When an user is redirected to 'Activity 2', 'Activity 1' goes to paused state and onPause() method is called.

 - When an user is active on 'Activity 2' for long time then 'Activity 1' goes from paused state to stopped state and calls onStop() function.

 - When an user switch to DM button then new UI comes in front of screen which we can say as 'Activity 3'.

- As soon as the user is redirected to DM page the 'Activity 3' comes in picture and call onCreate() function.

 - Let's highlight actions occurred by all three activities at the particular instance.

 - 'Activity 2' goes to pause state by calling onPause() Method as soon as 'Activity 3' is live.

 - Now suppose an user hits back button and gets back to 'Activity 2'.

 - 'Activity 2' goes to resume state by calling onResumeMethod(). And at the same instance 'Activity 3' attains pause state by calling onPause() Method.

 - Now 'Activity 2' is on resume state and it has called onResume() Method. Now suppose the user spend some time scrolling the memes on Instagram being active for long time on 'Activity 2'.

 - 'Activity 3' goes to stopped state and onStop() Method is called.

 - After sometime the user want to go back to the DM page that is 'Activity 3'. Then What Method will be called? What state will it attain?

 - Will it be onResume() Method?

 - Will it be onCreate() Method?

 - Will it be onRestart() Method?

![Screenshot 2023-10-19 000010.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FOneDrive%2FPictures%2FScreenshots%2FScreenshot%202023-10-19%20000010.png)

 - Read all the following and decide what Method will be used for the particular scenario?

![Screenshot 2023-10-19 000010.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FOneDrive%2FPictures%2FScreenshots%2FScreenshot%202023-10-19%20000010.png)

 - We will be calling onRestart() Method and go with restart state since the 'activity 3' previously attained stopped state and called onStop() Method.

![Screenshot 2023-10-19 000010.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FOneDrive%2FPictures%2FScreenshots%2FScreenshot%202023-10-19%20000010.png)

 - Suppose a user receives an incoming call with the notification banner on top while being active on 'Activity 3'.

 - Which state will be attained by 'Activity 3' after a talk-time of 10 minutes will be occurred after redirecting from 'Activity 3'?

![Screenshot 2023-10-19 004929.png](..%2F..%2F..%2FOneDrive%2FPictures%2FScreenshots%2FScreenshot%202023-10-19%20004929.png)

 - After the call is hanged up after 10 minutes. The 'Activity 3' attains paused state and immediately to stopped state.
