# Running the App on the Android Device

- Running your Android app on a physical device after connecting it via Wi-Fi debugging involves a few steps. 
- Assuming you've already set up Wi-Fi debugging as described earlier, here's how to run your app on the device:

1. **Connect Your Device via Wi-Fi Debugging**:
    - Ensure that your Android device and your development machine (where Android Studio is installed) are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.

2. **Open Your Android Project in Android Studio**:
    - Launch Android Studio on your computer.

3. **Configure Android Studio for Wireless Deployment**:
    - In Android Studio, open your Android project if it's not already open.
    - In the top toolbar, you'll see a dropdown list with the name of your connected device. Click on it and make sure your connected device is listed.

4. **Run Your App**:
    - Click the "Run" button (usually a green arrow) in the Android Studio toolbar. This will build your app and deploy it to the connected Android device.

5. **Select the Target Device**:
    - If you have multiple connected devices, Android Studio will prompt you to select the target device. Choose the connected device from the list.

6. **Wait for Deployment**:
    - Android Studio will compile your app and deploy it to the connected device. You can monitor the progress in the "Run" window at the bottom of Android Studio.

7. **Launch and Test Your App**:
    - Once the app is deployed, it should automatically launch on your Android device. You can interact with your app and test its functionality.

8. **Debug Your App (Optional)**:
    - If you want to debug your app, set breakpoints in your code as needed. You can use the debugging tools provided by Android Studio to inspect variables and step through your code.

- That's it! Your Android app should now be running on your physical device via Wi-Fi debugging. 
- You can make changes to your code, and rebuild, and redeploy the app as needed. 
- The wireless connection allows for more flexibility and freedom while developing and testing your Android applications.

# To enable on-device screen mirroring for a physical Android device in Android Studio, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**:
- You have already set up Wi-Fi debugging as described earlier.
- Your Android device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.

**Steps**:

1. **Enable Wireless Debugging**:
    - Ensure that Wi-Fi debugging is enabled on your Android device as described earlier.

2. **Open Android Studio**:
    - Launch Android Studio on your computer.

3. **Connect to the Device**:
    - In Android Studio, open the "Terminal" or "Command Prompt."

4. **Enable Screen Mirroring**:
    - Use the `adb` command to enable screen mirroring on your device. Replace `[device_ip]` with the IP address of your Android device:
      ```
      adb shell screenrecord --output-format=h264 --size=1280x720 --time-limit 300 - | ffplay -
      ```

   This command will start screen recording on your Android device and stream it to your computer using FFmpeg.

5. **Authorize the Connection**:
    - On your Android device, you may see a pop-up requesting authorization for the screen mirroring connection. Accept it to allow your computer to connect.

6. **Mirror the Screen**:
    - Your Android device's screen should now be mirrored on your computer's screen using FFmpeg. You can see and interact with your device's screen directly on your computer.

7. **Record the Screen (Optional)**:
    - While mirroring the screen, you can also record the screen by clicking the "Record" button in the FFmpeg window.

8. **Stop Screen Mirroring**:
    - To stop screen mirroring, press `Ctrl + C` in the Terminal or Command Prompt running the FFmpeg command. This will also stop the screen recording.

- That's it! You should now be able to see and interact with your Android device's screen on your computer. 
- This can be helpful for testing and debugging your app, as you can observe how it behaves on the physical device.

> Please note that the steps above use FFmpeg to stream the screen, and you'll need to have FFmpeg installed on your computer. 
> Additionally, screen mirroring can have some latency, so it may not be suitable for high-performance graphics testing.
