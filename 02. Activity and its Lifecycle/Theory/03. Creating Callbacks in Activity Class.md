# Callback Methods in Activity Class

- First of let's brief about what are the features of appCompatActivityClass() :

1. **Compatibility**: `AppCompatActivity` is a part of the Android Support Library (or AndroidX) and is designed to provide backward compatibility for newer Android features to older versions of Android. It allows you to use modern Android features while maintaining compatibility with older devices running older versions of Android.

2. **Extends Activity**: `AppCompatActivity` is an extension of the base `Activity` class, which is a core component in Android app development. This means you can use it in place of the standard `Activity` class in your app to take advantage of additional features and compatibility.

3. **Material Design**: It provides support for implementing Material Design guidelines, making it easier to create apps with a modern and consistent look and feel across different Android versions.

4. **Fragment Support**: `AppCompatActivity` works seamlessly with fragments, making it easy to create flexible and modular user interfaces.

5. **Action Bar Support**: It offers support for the Action Bar, making it easier to implement a standard top app bar with navigation features.

6. **App Theme Support**: `AppCompatActivity` helps in handling the app's theme and styling, which is important for creating a consistent and appealing user interface.

7. **Lifecycle Management**: It includes support for the Android Lifecycle and ViewModel classes, which simplifies managing the UI component's lifecycle and data handling.

8. **Backward Compatibility**: `AppCompatActivity` uses the AndroidX library, which is designed to provide compatibility with older Android versions. It resolves many issues related to fragmentation and inconsistency across different Android versions.

9. **Support Libraries**: `AppCompatActivity` is typically used in conjunction with other Android Support Library components, which offer additional features and compatibility for various Android features and APIs.

> When you create a new Android application using Android Studio, it often uses `AppCompatActivity` as the base/parent class for the main activity, as it's considered a best practice for modern Android app development.
> By using `AppCompatActivity`, developers can create applications that are both feature-rich and compatible with a wide range of Android devices, ultimately providing a better user experience across different Android versions.


 - Let's highlight a problem statement and try to resolve it.
    -  Problem Statement: Many times when we watch YouTube videos we rotate the screen from portrait to landscape or vice-versa.
    - In General, when we rotate the screen, the activity gets destroyed and new activity gets created at the instance of screen rotation.
    - But in the case of YouTube Video the video is neither paused nor does it stop or restarts.
        
      - So, how can we achieve this? How do we let a video play when the screen is rotated?
        - The answer is: Override the onSaveInstanceState() function. 
        - When we say 'override' we mean that we are using and adding or changing things in a function that has been defined elsewhere.
        - Before this, save the instance of the activity in a bundle.
        - Pass this bundle in the argument of the onSaveInstanceState() function.
       
      > 'Override' is a keyword in Kotlin. 
    
 - What is a bundle and why it is used?

   -  You must have seen that when you log in to your screen first time on 'G-Mail' using your e-mail ID.
   -  You're sometimes redirected to some other screen when you have to fill in your password.
   -  Now the e-mail that was filled in first screen gets transferred to the second screen.
   -  To transfer the data from one screen to another, we need bundles.
   -  That's because Android is a little rigid in the sense that it does not allow direct use of strings or data from one activity to the other.
   - That's why bundles come into the picture
       

 - What are bundles used for?
   -  A bundle is used to pass data from one activity to another.
   - This data can be in any form, like strings, integers, doubles, etc.

 - `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)`:

    - `super`: This keyword is used to call a method in the superclass (i.e., the parent class). In Android, activities are Java classes that extend the `AppCompatActivity` class, which itself extends the `Activity` class. When you call `super.onCreate(...)`, you are invoking the `onCreate` method of the parent class (`AppCompatActivity` or `Activity`).

    - `onCreate`: This is a lifecycle method in Android activities. It is called when the activity is being created or recreated. It's a crucial part of the Android activity lifecycle and is where you typically perform a one-time setup for your activity.

    - `savedInstanceState`: This parameter is a Bundle that holds the saved state of the activity. It is used to restore the activity's previous state if it was destroyed and recreated, such as when the device is rotated. If the activity is not being recreated (e.g., it's the first time it's being created), `savedInstanceState` is `null`.

   > So, `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)` is calling the `onCreate` method of the parent class (`AppCompatActivity` or `Activity`) and passing the saved state information to it. This allows the parent class to perform its own initialization and housekeeping tasks related to activity creation.

 - `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)`:

    - `setContentView`: This method is used to set the content view of the activity, which means specifying the layout for the user interface of the activity. The layout defines the structure and appearance of the user interface using XML files. In this line, you are telling the activity to use the XML layout defined in `activity_main.xml`.

    - `R.layout.activity_main`: This is a reference to the XML layout file for your activity. The `R` class is auto-generated by the Android build process, and it contains references to all resources (layouts, strings, images, etc.) in your Android project. In this case, `R.layout.activity_main` points to the XML layout file named `activity_main.xml`.

   > So, `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)` specifies that the UI for the current activity is defined by the `activity_main.xml` layout file. This XML layout file is inflated, and its contents become the visible user interface for the activity, allowing you to display various UI elements and widgets to the user.
