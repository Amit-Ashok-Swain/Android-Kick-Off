## <h1 align="center"> An Example of the Working of the Activity Lifecycle </h1>

   <p align="center">
   Let's take an example of an Instagram App
   </p>
  
   <p align = "center"> Login Page </p>

 - Enter the credentials in the e-mail and password fields to log in.

</p>

 - After entering the credentials click on the 'Login' button and let's call the UI 'Activity 1'

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/03.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Just after clicking the Login Button Activity 1 goes to pause state and the onPause() Method is called.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/04.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - We redirect to the next UI which is another Activity and we call it 'Activity 2'

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/05.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - When 'Activity 2' is opened up, the onCreate() method is called.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/06.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - When a user is redirected to 'Activity 2', 'Activity 1' goes to a paused state, and the onPause() method is called.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/07.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - When a user is active on 'Activity 2' for a long time then 'Activity 1' goes from a paused state to a stopped state and calls the onStop() function.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/08.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - When a user switches to the DM button then new UI comes in front of the screen which we can say is 'Activity 3'.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/09.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

- As soon as the user is redirected to the DM page the 'Activity 3' comes into the picture and calls the onCreate() function.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/10.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Let's highlight actions that occurred by all three activities at the particular instance.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/11.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - 'Activity 2' goes to pause state by calling the onPause() Method as soon as 'Activity 3' is live.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/12.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Now suppose a user hits the back button and gets back to 'Activity 2'.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/13.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - 'Activity 2' goes to resume state by calling onResumeMethod(). At the same instance 'Activity 3' attains a pause state by calling the onPause() Method.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/14.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Now 'Activity 2' is in resume state and it has called onResume() Method. Now suppose the user spends some time scrolling the memes on Instagram being active for a long time on 'Activity 2'.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/15.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - 'Activity 3' goes to the stopped state and the onStop() Method is called.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/16.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - After some time the user wants to go back to the DM page that is 'Activity 3'. Then What Method will be called? What state will it attain? Will it be the onResume() Method?

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/17.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Will it be onCreate() Method?

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/18.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Will it be onRestart() Method?

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/19.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>


<p align="center">

</p>

 - Read all the following Methods above and decide what Method will be used for the particular scenario.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/22.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - We will be calling the onRestart() Method and going with the restart state since 'activity 3' previously attained a stopped state and called the onStop() Method.
   
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/23.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - Suppose a user receives an incoming call with the notification banner on top while being active on 'Activity 3'.
   
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/24.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/25.png" alt="Image Description" />

    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/26.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - The call was hung up after 10 minutes.  Which state will be attained by 'Activity 3' after a talk time of 10 minutes will occur after redirecting from 'Activity 3'?

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/27.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

The call was hung up after 10 minutes.  Which state will be attained by 'Activity 3' after a talk time of 10 minutes will occur after redirecting from 'Activity 3'?

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/28.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

 - After the call is hung up after 10 minutes. 'Activity 3' attains a paused state and immediately to a stopped state.

   <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/29.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/30.png" alt="Image Description" />
</p>

- As 'Activity 3' attains the paused state by calling the onPause() Method. It immediately moves to the stop state by calling the onStop() Method.

   <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/Amit-Ashok-Swain/Android-Kick-Off/blob/main/images/An-Example-of-the-Activity-Life-Cycle/31.png" alt="Image Description" />

</p>

- If the user keeps on hitting the back button and closes the app. Then all the activities go to destroy the state by calling onDestroy Method

  #### Taking this example into consideration we conclude the explanation of Activities and their Lifecycle synoptically and let's move on to practical demonstrations
