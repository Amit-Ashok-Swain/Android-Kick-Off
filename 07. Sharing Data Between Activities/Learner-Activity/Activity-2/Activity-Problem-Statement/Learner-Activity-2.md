# Learner Activity - 2

- Change the name of the MainActivity to AvengersActivity and its layout name to activity_avengers.
- Next, in the Avengers screen add a new EditText and a Button with the text ‘Send’. 
- Now add a new activity called ‘MessageActivity’ with a TextView present at the center of the screen. 
- Now, add the functionality that whatever gets typed inside the EditText is displayed in the TextView present on the next screen.

> Note: In order to set a text in the TextView from Kotlin, use the code:
     textviewVariableName.text = textToBeAdded
