# Understanding View and ViewGroup Objects

  ## What is a layout?
    - A layout defines the structure in which the various elements on the screen or the activity will be arranged.
    - All the elements in the layout are built using a hierarchy of View and ViewGroup objects.

    ### View
     - A View object is something that is drawn and that the user interacts with.
     - It is a concrete element on the screen that is visible to the user.
     - They are called Widgets.
