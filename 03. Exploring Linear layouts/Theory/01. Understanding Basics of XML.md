# Understanding Basics of XML

## Basics of XML

  - Code in XML is written using tags.
    
   For Example : 

     - Long Synatx Tags
    
         Example 1 : <Tag></Tag>
          <Tag> - Opening Tag
          </Tag> - Closing Tag

          Example 2 : <LinearLayout></Linear Layout>
    
     - Short Syntax Tags 
          
           <Tag>/</Tag> = <Tag/>
           <LinearLayout></LinearLayout> = <LinearLayout/>

  - There are parent and child tags in XMl. Parent tags have child tags inside them.

   For Example :
      
     <ParentTag>
        <ChildOne>
        </ChildOne>

        <ChildTwo>
        </ChildTwo>
     </ParentTag>

  - The short syntax for writing a tag is only used when that tag does not have any child tags. If the tags have children then they will be present between the two parent tags (opening and closing).
   
   For Example :

     <ParentTag>
         <ChildOne/>
         
         <ChildTwo>
         </ChildTwo>

         <ChildThree/>
     <ParentTag>
     
   
## Syntax for writing tags

 - For Example :
 
   <LinearLayout
    android:width="match_parent"
    android:height="match_parent">
   </LinearLayout>

 <LinearLayout></LinearLayout> - Name of the tag with opening and closing tags.
 
 android:width="match_parent" and android:height="match_parent"> are the attributes of the LinearLayout Tags. The attributes will always have some value which is always written in Double quotation marks(" "). The attributes are written inside the opening tag.

> Understanding the basics of XML (Extensible Markup Language) is crucial for Android development because XML is used extensively for defining the user interface, layouts, and other resources in Android applications. 
 
## Here are the fundamental concepts and elements of XML in the context of Android development:

1. **XML Structure**:
    - XML is a markup language that uses tags to define structured data. It consists of opening and closing tags that enclose data. Tags are case-sensitive, and they should be properly nested.
    - An XML document should have a single root element that encloses all other elements.

2. **Elements**:
    - Elements are the building blocks of an XML document. They are enclosed within angle brackets (`<` and `>`).
    - Elements can have attributes, which are specified within the opening tag. For example:
      ```xml
      <TextView
          android:id="@+id/myTextView"
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:text="Hello, World!"
      />
      ```

3. **Attributes**:
    - Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are key-value pairs specified within the opening tag.
    - In Android XML layouts, attributes define properties such as `id`, `layout_width`, `layout_height`, and more.

4. **Namespace**:
    - XML namespaces are used to avoid conflicts when elements or attributes with the same name are used in different contexts. In Android, you'll often see the `xmlns` attribute used to define namespaces, particularly for Android-specific attributes.
    - Example of defining the Android XML namespace:
      ```xml
      xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
      ```

5. **Resource IDs**:
    - In Android XML, you can define resource IDs for elements and refer to them in your Java/Kotlin code. Resource IDs are specified with the `@+id/` prefix.
    - Example:
      ```xml
      <Button
          android:id="@+id/myButton"
          android:layout_width="wrap_content"
          android:layout_height="wrap_content"
          android:text="Click Me"
      />
      ```

6. **Layouts**:
    - XML is used to define layouts for Android apps. Layouts determine how views and widgets are arranged on the screen. Common layout types include `LinearLayout`, `RelativeLayout`, `ConstraintLayout`, and more.

7. **Resources**:
    - In Android, XML is used to define various resources like strings, colors, dimensions, and styles. These resources can be reused throughout the app to maintain consistency.

8. **Data Binding**:
    - Android supports data binding, which allows you to bind XML layout elements directly to data sources, reducing the need for manual UI updates.

9. **Validation**:
    - XML documents must be well-formed and valid. Tools like Android Studio's layout editor and lint checks help ensure that XML layout files are correctly structured.

10. **Inflation**:
    - In Android, XML layout files are inflated, meaning they are transformed into actual View objects at runtime. This allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

11. **Android XML Files**:
    - Android-specific XML files are used to define layouts, resources, menus, manifests, and more. These files have a specific structure and follow the Android XML namespace.

12. **Event Handling**:
    - XML can also define event handlers for UI elements. For example, you can specify `onClick` attributes to define the behavior when a button is clicked.

> Android Studio's visual layout editor and code completion can assist in creating XML layouts effectively.
