# The code provided appears to be a simple Android app written in Kotlin. 
- It defines an Android activity within the `com.androidkickofftraining.activitylifecycle` package. 
- Let's break it down step by step:

```kotlin
package com.androidkickofftraining.activitylifecycle
```

- This line specifies the package to which the class belongs. In this case,
  it's `com.androidkickofftraining.activitylifecycle`, which is a common structure for Android app
  packages.

```kotlin
import androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity
import android.os.Bundle
```

- These are import statements. They bring in classes and packages necessary for this
  code. `AppCompatActivity` is a class provided by Android's appcompat library, which helps with
  backward compatibility for newer Android features. `Bundle` is a class used for passing data
  between Android components.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() { //class MainActivity inherits AppCompatActivity -> here AppCompatActivity is the parent class and MainActivity is child class
// write your code here
}
```

- This line declares a class named `MainActivity`, which is an Android activity. The colon `:`
  indicates that `MainActivity` extends (inherits from) `AppCompatActivity`. This means
  that `MainActivity` is a type of activity, specifically an AppCompatActivity.

```kotlin
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) { // it takes Bundle as an object with safe call and assigned to savedInstanceState as a parameter
        // write your code here 
    }
```

- This line defines a method called `onCreate`. This method is part of the Android Activity
  lifecycle and is called when the activity is created. It takes a `Bundle`
  object, `savedInstanceState`, as a parameter. This bundle is used to store and retrieve the state
  of the activity in case it is recreated.

```kotlin
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState) // using super keyword it calls the parent class AppCompatActivity with Bundle parameter named as savedInstanceState
```

- This line calls the `onCreate` method of the superclass (`AppCompatActivity`)
  using `super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)`. This is important because it allows the parent class
  to perform its necessary setup.

```kotlin
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main) // setContentView references to the res(resource directory) with capital Alphabet 'R' and chooses sub-directory as 'layout' using dot product(R.layout -> res.layout) where xml file activity_main is present.
```

- This line sets the content view of the activity to a layout defined in an XML
  file. `R.layout.activity_main` is a reference to the layout resource file called `activity_main`.
  It tells the activity to display the UI defined in this layout.

# So, in summary, this code defines an Android activity called `MainActivity` that inherits from `AppCompatActivity`. 
  - In its `onCreate` method, it sets the content view of the activity to the UI layout defined in the `activity_main` XML file. 
  - This is a common structure for simple Android applications, where the UI layout and the code that manages the UI are separated for better organization and maintainability.
