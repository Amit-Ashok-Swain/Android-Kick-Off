# An XML resource file typically named `colors.xml`. 
- It's used to define color resources for an Android app. 
- Let's break down the code:

```xml
<root>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>   
</root>
```

- This is the XML declaration, specifying the XML version and character encoding used in the file.

```xml
<resources/>
```

- The `<resources>` element is the root element for defining resources in an Android resource file.

```xml
    <color name="black">#FF000000</color>
```

- This line defines a color resource with the name "black" and the hexadecimal color value "#FF000000." The format of the color value is #AARRGGBB, where AA represents the alpha channel (transparency), RR represents the red component, GG represents the green component, and BB represents the blue component. In this case, it's fully opaque (FF) and pure black (0,0,0).

```xml
    <color name="white">#FFFFFFFF</color>
```

- This line defines another color resource with the name "white" and the hexadecimal color value "#FFFFFFFF." This color is fully opaque (FF) and pure white (255,255,255).

### In summary, this XML resource file defines two color resources named "black" and "white," each with a unique color value. 
- These color resources can be referenced and used in various parts of your Android app's code, such as XML layouts, styles, and more. 
- Defining colors in a centralized resource file makes it easy to maintain and change the app's color scheme consistently.
