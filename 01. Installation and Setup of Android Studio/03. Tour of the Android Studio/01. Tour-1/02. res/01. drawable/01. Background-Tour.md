# The code you provided is an XML vector drawable resource file. 
- Vector drawables are used in Android to define scalable graphics using XML, and they are particularly useful for ensuring that your images and icons look crisp and clear on various screen sizes and resolutions. 
- Let's break down this code:

```xml
<root>
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>   
</root>
```
- This is the XML declaration. It specifies the XML version and character encoding used in the file.

```xml
<vector xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:width="108dp"
    android:height="108dp"
    android:viewportWidth="108"
    android:viewportHeight="108"/>
```
- The `<vector>` element is the root element of a vector drawable. It contains several attributes:
    - `xmlns:android` defines an XML namespace for attributes used in this document, linking to the Android XML namespace.
    - `android:width` and `android:height` set the intrinsic width and height of the vector drawable to 108 density-independent pixels (dp).
    - `android:viewportWidth` and `android:viewportHeight` specify the coordinate system's width and height. These attributes define the coordinate space in which the vector is drawn.

```xml
    <path
        android:fillColor="#3DDC84"
        android:pathData="M0,0h108v108h-108z" />
```
- The `<path>` element defines a shape within the vector drawable. This path draws a filled rectangle:
    - `android:fillColor` sets the fill color of the path.
    - `android:pathData` describes the path using a series of commands. In this case, it moves to (0,0), draws a horizontal line to 108, a vertical line to 108, and another horizontal line back to 0, forming a closed rectangle.

- The following blocks of code are very similar, and each draws horizontal and vertical lines to create a grid-like pattern within the vector drawable. 
- They all use the same `android:strokeWidth` and `android:strokeColor` attributes to define the stroke (outline) of the lines. 
- The `M` command in the `android:pathData` attribute represents a move to a starting point, and `L` commands draw lines.

# In summary, this XML vector drawable defines a graphic that includes a filled rectangle and a grid pattern. 
- The `android:width` and `android:height` attributes specify its size, and the `android:viewportWidth` and `android:viewportHeight` attributes define the coordinate system for drawing. 
- This vector drawable can be used as an image or icon in an Android app and will scale smoothly to various screen sizes and resolutions.
