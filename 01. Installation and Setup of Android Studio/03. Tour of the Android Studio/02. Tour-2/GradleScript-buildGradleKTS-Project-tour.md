# A Kotlin build script for an Android project
- This script is typically located in the project's top-level directory and is used for configuring settings and dependencies that are common to all sub-projects and modules within the Android project. 
- Let's break down the code:

```kotlin
// Top-level build file where you can add configuration options common to all sub-projects/modules.
```

- This comment provides a brief description of the purpose of the build script, which is to add configuration options that are shared across all sub-projects and modules in the Android project.

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application") version "8.1.2" apply false
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "1.9.0-RC" apply false
}
```

- In this section, plugins are defined and configured. Plugins are used to extend the functionality of the Gradle build system. Let's break down each line:

    - `id("com.android.application") version "8.1.2" apply false`: This line specifies the Android application plugin. It's used to build Android applications. The `version` attribute indicates the version of the plugin, and `apply false` means the plugin is not applied at this level but might be applied in sub-projects or modules. This allows you to apply the Android application plugin selectively.

    - `id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "1.9.0-RC" apply false`: This line specifies the Kotlin Android plugin. It's used to support the Kotlin programming language in Android projects. The `version` attribute indicates the version of the plugin, and `apply false` means the plugin is not applied at this level but might be applied in sub-projects or modules.

### These plugin configurations set the stage for building Android apps with Kotlin but do not apply these plugins to the current build script. 
- Instead, they are configured for potential use in sub-projects or modules. 
- The exact use and application of these plugins will depend on the structure and requirements of your Android project, which are typically defined in the build.gradle files of specific modules or sub-projects.
