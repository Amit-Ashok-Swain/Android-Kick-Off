- For we need to enable the Kotlin file to listen to the user's actions or events and respond to that.
- To do so we will initialize view variable using 'lateinit' keyword and 'findViewById()' functions.
- In Kotlin, `lateinit` and `findViewById` are commonly used in Android app development to work with views in the user interface.

1. **`lateinit`**:

  - `lateinit` is a keyword in Kotlin used to declare non-nullable properties that are initialized at a later point in the code.
  - It's often used when working with Android Views, as they are typically initialized in the `onCreate` method of an `Activity` or in a `Fragment`.
  - You use `lateinit` when you are sure that you will initialize the variable before accessing it, and it helps you avoid the need to work with nullable types.
  - Here's an example of how to use `lateinit` with an `EditText` in an Android `Activity`:

   ```kotlin
   lateinit var editText: EditText

   override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
       setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
       
       // Initialize the editText in the onCreate method
       editText = findViewById(R.id.editText)
       
       // Now you can use editText without worrying about nullability.
       editText.text = "Hello, World!"
   }
   ```

  - The `editText` variable is declared with `lateinit`, and its initialization occurs in the `onCreate` method before you access it.

2. **`findViewById`**:

  - The findViewById() function finds the Views by looking at their IDs and connects them to the variables we have declared.
  - `findViewById` is a method provided by Android to locate a specific view by its resource ID from the layout XML file.
  - It is often used within an `Activity` or `Fragment` to reference UI elements (e.g., buttons, text fields) defined in the layout XML.
  - You call `findViewById` to get a reference to the view, and you can then manipulate or interact with that view in your code.
  - This functions is defined in the libraries of Android SDK.
  - Here's an example of how to use `findViewById` to get a reference to a `Button` in an Android `Activity`:

   ```kotlin
   override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
       setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)
       
       val button = findViewById<Button>(R.id.myButton)
       
       button.setOnClickListener {
           // Handle button click here
       }
   }
   ```

  - In this example, `findViewById` is used to locate a `Button` with the resource ID `myButton` in the layout XML and assign it to the `button` variable.

  - `lateinit` and `findViewById` are commonly used in conjunction when working with Android UI elements in Kotlin. You use `findViewById` to obtain references to UI elements, and `lateinit` to declare and initialize these variables with non-nullable types, ensuring that they are ready for use in the code.

> So now whatever data or information we get from the views will now be stored in variables i.e(button and editText).

- But before we can collected data, we need to make your buttons or linked clickable.
-  So, let's learn how to add Event listeners to the view.
- What is Event listeners and an event?
  - Event Listeners simply enable us, or our code, to listen to an event.
  - An event is anything that the user does on the app, such as clicking a button or a link.
- We will first put the onClickListener() on the button in our layout.
- Let's detail about Events, Event Listeners and OnClickListener:
  - In Android app development, events, event listeners, and `OnClickListener` are key concepts related to user interface interaction and handling user actions. 
  - Here's an overview of each of these concepts:

1. **Events**:

  - Events are actions or occurrences that happen during the runtime of an Android application. Examples of events include button clicks, screen touches, text input, and system events like device rotation.
  - Events are crucial for user interaction, as they allow users to interact with the app by triggering actions based on their actions.
  - Events can be related to UI components (e.g., a button click) or other system events (e.g., a change in device orientation).

2. **Event Listeners**:

  - Event listeners are objects or functions that "listen" for and respond to specific events when they occur.
  - They are used to handle and react to events in an application. Event listeners are often associated with UI components.
  - Event listeners are responsible for executing code or functions when an event is triggered.

3. **OnClickListener**:

  - `OnClickListener` is a specific type of event listener used in Android to handle click events on UI elements like buttons, views, or other clickable components.
  - To respond to a click event, you typically set an `OnClickListener` on the target UI element, and you specify the code or actions you want to perform when the element is clicked.
  - Here's an example of how to use `OnClickListener` with a `Button` in Android:

    ```kotlin
    val button = findViewById<Button>(R.id.myButton)
    button.setOnClickListener {
        // Code to execute when the button is clicked
        // For example, show a toast message
        Toast.makeText(this, "Button Clicked", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
    }
    ```

  - In this example, an `OnClickListener` is set on the `Button` using the `setOnClickListener` method. When the button is clicked, the specified code block is executed.

- In summary, events represent user actions and system occurrences in an Android application. 
- Event listeners are responsible for handling these events, and `OnClickListener` is a specific type of event listener used to respond to click events on UI components like buttons. 
- Event handling is crucial for creating interactive and responsive user interfaces in Android apps.

- Where did the Views that we have been using till now, come from?
  - The Views that we have been dealing with till now, are declared and defined inside the class 'View'.
  - Also, this View class has an interface called OnClickListener.
  - This interface has a method called onClick().

- In Android app development, the `View` class is a fundamental component that serves as the base class for all UI elements, including buttons, text views, image views, and more. 
- It is part of the Android UI framework and provides the core functionality for rendering and interacting with user interface elements. 
- The `View` class itself is an abstract class, meaning you typically work with its subclasses when creating UI elements.

- Here are some key points about the `View` class and its important interfaces:

1. **View Class**:
  - `View` is the base class for all UI components in Android.
  - It provides essential methods and properties for rendering and interacting with UI elements.

2. **Subclasses**:
  - Various UI components, such as `Button`, `TextView`, `ImageView`, and many more, are derived from the `View` class.
  - Each subclass has its own specific properties and methods to customize the behavior and appearance of that UI element.

3. **Common Properties and Methods**:
  - The `View` class and its subclasses share common properties and methods, including:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for the view.
    - `layoutParams`: Defines how the view is positioned and sized within its parent layout.
    - `visibility`: Controls the visibility of the view (e.g., `VISIBLE`, `INVISIBLE`, or `GONE`).
    - `setOnClickListener()`: Used to set click event listeners for the view.

4. **Interfaces**:
  - The `View` class and its subclasses implement various interfaces to handle events and interactions. Some of the important interfaces include:
    - `OnClickListener`: Handles click events when the user taps the view.
    - `OnLongClickListener`: Manages long-press events.
    - `OnTouchListener`: Provides callbacks for touch events.
    - `OnFocusChangeListener`: Reacts to focus changes on the view.
    - `OnKeyListener`: Listens for key events, like hardware keyboard input.

5. **Custom Views**:
  - You can create custom views by subclassing the `View` class or its derivatives and implementing your own drawing and interaction logic. This is useful when you need to create unique UI components that aren't available as standard Android widgets.

6. **View Hierarchy**:
  - Views are organized into a hierarchy, where a parent view can contain child views. This hierarchy allows you to create complex layouts and design intricate user interfaces.

> Overall, the `View` class and its related interfaces are the building blocks of Android user interfaces. 
> By customizing and working with these classes, you can create rich, interactive, and visually appealing apps for Android devices.

- Certainly, here's how you can work with Toasts in Kotlin, along with some Kotlin-specific examples:

1. **Creating a Toast**:
   To create and display a Toast in Kotlin, you can use the `Toast.makeText()` method:

   ```kotlin
   Toast.makeText(context, "This is a toast message", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
   ```

   Here, `context` is typically an instance of the `Context` class, such as the activity or application context.

2. **Customizing a Toast**:
   If you want to customize a Toast with a custom layout, you can create a custom layout XML file and inflate it. Here's how you can do it in Kotlin:

   ```kotlin
   val inflater = layoutInflater
   val customToastView = inflater.inflate(R.layout.custom_toast_layout, null)

   val customToast = Toast(context)
   customToast.view = customToastView
   customToast.duration = Toast.LENGTH_SHORT
   customToast.show()
   ```

   In this example, `customToastView` is a custom layout that you've defined in XML.

3. **Canceling a Toast**:
   To cancel (dismiss) a Toast before its duration ends, you can call the `cancel()` method on the Toast object:

   ```kotlin
   val toast = Toast.makeText(context, "This toast can be canceled", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT)
   toast.show()
   // Later in your code, you can cancel the toast
   toast.cancel()
   ```

4. **Short and Long Duration**:
   As in Java, you can use `Toast.LENGTH_SHORT` and `Toast.LENGTH_LONG` to specify the duration when creating a Toast in Kotlin:

   ```kotlin
   Toast.makeText(context, "Short Duration Toast", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
   Toast.makeText(context, "Long Duration Toast", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
   ```

> Kotlin allows you to use the more concise syntax and provides some benefits, such as null safety, which can make working with Toasts cleaner and safer. 
> However, the fundamental principles of creating, customizing, and displaying Toasts remain the same as in Java.

## Steps for implementing a click on a View:
  - First, we declared variables for the various Views by using the 'lateinit' keyword.
  - Then, we initialised these variables inside the onCreate() method, by using the findViewById() method.
  - We used the setOnClickListener() on the button, to set a click on the button.
  - To provide a framework for this click listener, we implemented the OnClickListener() interface of the Views class and then implemented its on Click() method.
  - Then we passed the 'this' parameter inside the setOnClickListener() method to use the onClick() method we implemented earlier.
  - Finally, we created a Toast inside the onClick() method and displayed it on the screen.
